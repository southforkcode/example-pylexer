# example-pylexer

This project illustrates how to write a file or string stream based lexer. A lexer will break the stream into tokens of different types based on the lexer rules.

This is only an example. It is not a library. You are free to clone it and modify the cloned version as your own. I do not own any IP related to this as this example is pretty much a demonstration of basic, core fundamentals of lexically analyzing a text input into discrete tokens. The output of these tokens can feed a parser, which then can implement a compiler or interpreter, as well as other things.

This demonstration is implemented in Python 3.10, however, none of the concepts here are specific to Python beyond the basic string and IO stream handling functions. The ideas here will be transferable to C++ and other modern languages.

You are free to use the source code as-is or with modifications. There is no license as I cannot claim to have invented any part of the ideas there. It is purely a demonstration.
